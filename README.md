# python-trading-bot

-	Developed a trading strategy that trades breakouts on the daily timeframe with a lookback period dependent on volatility and a trailing stop-loss.
-	Utilized QuantConnect and NumPy to create a Trading Bot using Python and applied this strategy to SPY.
-	Backtested strategy, testing parameters for stop-loss and trailing stop-loss, and saw an 86.7% ROI over last 5 years.
